# Compilation Instructions
To compile and run each program, you must have a g++ compiler which can support C++20. We used Visual Studio Code configured with a g++ compiler to develop this project. To run each file as an executable, open a terminal and type in the following g++ command:
```
g++ {filename}.cpp -o {executable_name}
```
Once you have compiled your cpp file, it will now be available as an executable. You can run it by typing the following into your terminal:
```
./{executable_name}
```
